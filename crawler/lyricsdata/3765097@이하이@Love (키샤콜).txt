I used to think that I wasn't fine enoughAnd I used to think that I wasn't wild enoughBut I won't waste my time tryin to figure outWhy you are playin games what's this all aboutAnd I can't believe your hurting me I met your girl what a differenceWhat you seen in her you ain't seen in meBut I guess it was all Just make believeOh Love never knew what I was missinBut I knew once we start kissin I foundLove never knew what I was missinBut I knew once we start kissin I found youNow you're gone what it my I gonna do so oo empty my heart my soulCan't go on go on baby without youRainy days fade away when you come around say you're here to stayWith me boy I don't want you to leave me I need youLove never knew what I was missinBut I knew once we start kissin I foundLove never knew what I was missinBut I knew once we start kissin I foundFound you
