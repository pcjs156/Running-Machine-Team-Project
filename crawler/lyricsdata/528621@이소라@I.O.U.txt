You believe, that I've changed your life forever And you're never gonna find another somebody like me And you wish, you had more than just a life time To give back all I've given you and that's you believe But I owe you the sunlight in the morning And the nights of all this loving that time can't take away I owe you more than life, now more than ever I know that it's the sweetest debt I'll ever have to pay I'm amazed when you say it's me you live for You know that when I'm holding you, you're right where you belong And my love, I can't help but smile with wonder When you tell me all I've done for you Cause I've known all along But I owe you the sunlight in the morning And the nights of all this loving that time can't take away And I owe you more than life, now more than ever I know the it's the sweetest debt I'll ever have to pay Cause I owe you the sunlight in the morning And the nights of all this loving that time can't take away I owe you more than life, now more than ever I know that it's the sweetest debt I'll ever have to pay -
