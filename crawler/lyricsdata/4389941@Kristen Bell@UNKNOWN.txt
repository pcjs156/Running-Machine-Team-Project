The window is open So's that doorI didn't know they did that anymoreWho knew we owned eight thousand salad platesFor years I've roamed these empty hallsWhy have a ballroom with no ballsFinally they're opening up the gatesThere'll be actual real live peopleIt'll be totally strangeBut wow Am I so ready for this change'Cause for the first time in foreverThere'll be music there'll be lightFor the first time in foreverI'll be dancing through the nightDon't know if I'm elated or gassyBut I'm somewhere in that zoneCause for the first time in foreverI won't be aloneI can't wait to meet everyone What if I meet the oneTonight imagine me gown and allFetchingly draped against the wallThe picture of sophisticated graceOoh I suddenly see him standing thereA beautiful stranger tall and fairI wanna stuff some chocolate in my faceBut then we laugh and talk all eveningWhich is totally bizarreNothing like the lifeI've lead so farFor the first time in foreverThere'll be magic there'll be funFor the first time in foreverI could be noticed by someoneAnd I know it is totally crazyTo dream I'd find romanceBut for the first time in foreverAt least I've got a chanceDon't let them in Don't let them seeBe the good girl You always have to beConceal Don't feel Put on a showMake one wrong move And everyone will know But it's only for todayIt's only for todayIt's agony to waitIt's agony to waitTell the guards to open up the gate the gateFor the first time in foreverDon't let them inI'm getting what I'm dreaming ofBe the good girl you always have to beA chance to changemy lonely world ConcealA chance to find true loveConceal don't feel Don't let them knowI know it all ends tomorrowSo it has to be today'Cause for the first time in foreverFor the first time in foreverNothing's in my way
