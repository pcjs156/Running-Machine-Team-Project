Please don't see just a boycaught up in dreams and fantasiesPlease see me reaching out for someone I can't seeTake my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrowBest laid plans sometimes are just a one night standI'd be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrowSo let's get drunk on our tears andGod tell us the reason youth is wasted on the youngIt's hunting season and this lamb is on the runSearching for meaningBut are we all lost stars trying to light up the darkWho are we Just a speck of dust within the galaxyWoe is me if we're not careful turns into realityDon't you dare let all these memories bring you sorrowYesterday I saw a lion kiss a deerTurn the pageMaybe we'll find a brand new endingWhere we're dancing in our tears andGod tell us the reason youth is wasted on the youngIt's hunting season and this lamb is on the runsearching for meaningBut are we all lost stars trying to light up the darkI thought I saw you out there cryingI thought I heard you call my nameI thought I heard you out there cryingWe're just the sameGod give us the reason youth is wasted on the youngIt's hunting season and this lamb is on the runWe're searching for meaningBut are we all lost stars trying to light up the darkI thought I saw you out there cryingI thought I heard you call my nameI thought I heard you out there cryingBut are we all lost stars trying to light up the darkAre we all lost stars trying to light up the dark
