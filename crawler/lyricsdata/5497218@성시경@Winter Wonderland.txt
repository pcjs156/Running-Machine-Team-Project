Sleigh bells ring are youlisteningIn the lane snow is glisteningA beautiful sightWe’re happy tonightWalking in a winter wonderlandGone away is the bluebirdHere to stay is a new birdHe sings a love songAs we go alongWalking in a winter wonderlandIn the meadow we can build asnowmanThen pretend that he is ParsonBrownHe'll say Are you marriedWe’ll say No manBut you can do the jobWhen you're in townGone away is the bluebirdHere to stay is a new birdHe sings a love songAs we go alongWalking in a winter wonderlandIn the meadow we can build asnowmanThen pretend that he is ParsonBrownHe'll say Are you marriedWe’ll say No manBut you can do the jobWhen you're in townLater on we’ll conspireAs we dream by the fireTo face unafraid the plans thatwe've madeWalking in a winter wonderlandWalking in a winter wonderlandWalking in a winter wonderland
