Hey lady you lady cursing at your life You're a discontented mother and a regimented wife I've no doubt you dream about the things you'll never do But I wish someone had talked to me like I wanna talk to you Ooh I've been to Georgia and California and anywhere I could run I took the hand of a preacher man and we made love in the sun but I ran out of places and friendly faces because I had to be free I've been to paradise but I've never been to me Please lady please lady don't just walk away 'cause I have this need to tell you why I'm all alone today I can see so much of me still living in your eyes won't you share a part of a weary heart that has lived a million lies Ooh I've been to Niece and the Isle of Greece while I've sipped champagne on a yacht I've moved like Harlowin Monte Carlo and showed 'em what I've got I've been undressed by kings and I've seen some things that a woman ain't supposed to see I've been to paradise but I've never been to me  Sometimes I've been crying for unborn children that might have made me complete but I I took the sweet life I never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet I've spent my life exploring the subtle whoring that costs too much to be free I've been to paradise never been to me  I've been to paradise but I've never been to me
