Eh I shouldn't have walked away I would have stayed if you'd say We could've made everything okay but we just threw the blame back and forth We treated love like a sport The final blow hit so low I'm still on the ground I could have prepared myself for this round Shattered and pieces curled on the floor Supernatural love conquers Remember we used to touch the sky And lightning don't strike the same place twice When you and I Said goodbye I felt the angels cry True love's a gift But we let it drift in the storm Every night I feel the angels cry Come on babe Can our love be revived Bring it back and we gon' make it right I'm on the edge just trying to survive As the angels cry Limitless omnipresent kind of love couldn't have guessed It would just stop and disappear in a world when here I am walking on this narrow road Wobbling but won't let go Waiting for a glimpse of the suns glow I know I can stand just pull me back up Like there ain't a hurricane it's just us I'm willing to live and die for our love Baby we can get back that shine And lightning don't strike the same place twice When you and I Said goodbye I felt the angels cry True love's a gift But we let it drift in the storm Every night I feel the angels cry Come on babe Can our love be revived Bring it back and we gon' make it right I'm on the edge just trying to survive As the angels cry Baby I miss you Don't allow our love to lose We gotta ride it through I'm reaching for you Baby I'm missing you Don't allow our love to lose We gotta ride it through I'm reaching for you Lightning don't strike The same place twice You and I Said goodbye Felt the angels cry True love's a gift We let it slip In the storm Every night I feel the angels cry
