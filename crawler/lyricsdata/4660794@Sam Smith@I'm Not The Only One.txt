You and me we made a vowFor better or for worseI can't believe you let me downBut the proof is in the way it hurtsFor months on end I've had my doubtsDenying every tearI wish this would be over nowBut I know that I still need you hereYou say I'm crazyCause you don't thinkI know what you've doneBut when you call me babyI know I'm not the only oneYou've been so unfaithfulNow sadly I know whyYour heart is unobtainableEven though lord knowsyou have mineYou say I'm crazyCause you don't thinkI know what you've doneBut when you call me babyI know I'm not the only oneI have loved you for many yearsMaybe I am just not enoughYou've made me realise my deepest fearBy lying and tearing us upYou say I'm crazyCause you don't think I know what you've doneBut when you call me babyI know I'm not the only oneYou say I'm crazyCause you don't think I know what you've doneBut when you call me babyI know I'm not the only oneI know I'm not the only oneI know I'm not the only one And I knowI know I'm not the only one
