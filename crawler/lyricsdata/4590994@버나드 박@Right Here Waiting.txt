Oceans apart day after day And I slowly go insane I hear your voice on the line But it doesn't stop the pain If I see you next to never How can we say forever Wherever you go Whatever you do I will be right here waiting for you Whatever it takes Or how my heart breaks I will be right here waiting for you Oh can't you see it babyYou've got me goin' crazyWherever you goWhatever you doI will be right here waiting foryouWhatever it takesOr how my heart breaksI will be right here waiting foryouWherever you goWhatever you doI will be right here waiting foryouWhatever it takesOr how my heart breaksI will be right here waiting foryou
