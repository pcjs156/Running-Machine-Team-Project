I spent all my money on a big  old fancy car For these bright eyed honeys Oh yeah you know who you are Keep me up till the sun is high Till the birds stop calling  my name I'm addicted and I don't  know why Guess I've always been  this way All these roads steer  me wrong But I still drive them all night  long all night long All you young wild girls You make a mess of me Yeah you young wild girls You'll be the death of me  the death of me All you young wild girls No matter what you do Yeah you young wild girls I'll always come back to you  come back to youI get lost under these lights I get lost in the words I say Stop believing my own lies Like everything will be okay Oh I still dream of simple life Boy meets girl makes her  his wife But love don't exist when you live like this that much I know yes I knowAll these roads steer me wrongBut I still drive them all night long all night longAll you young wild girlsYou make a mess of meYeah you young wild girlsYou'll be the death of me the death of meAll you young wild girlsNo matter what you doYeah you young wild girlsI'll always come back to you come back to youYou you you youYeah you you youYou you you youAll you young wild girlsYou make a mess of meYeah you young wild girlsYou'll be the death of me the death of meAll you young wild girlsNo matter what you doYeah you young wild girlsI'll always come back to you come back to you
