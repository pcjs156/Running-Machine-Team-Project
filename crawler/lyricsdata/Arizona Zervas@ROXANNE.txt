She's not your type.She's not the kind to play the field. Why don't you leave her to me?CHORUSCharlene. Charlene. I got to write a letter to Charlene. Charlene.Cause you should know the words she says to me. (Won't you be my guy?)Are the words she says to me. (And it feels so nice.) A letter to Charlene. Charlene.I've got to get a message to Charlene. Charlene. And give the girl an answer to her words.Answer to her words. And she's the one for me. The one. Oh! Oh! A letter to Charlene.She's all I know. She makes my life. If she should leave, I wouldn't survive.Now don't you go to fond with her. Don't push your luck not in my girl. Take all your love.Take all your chance to someone else and not to her arms. Now can't you read between the lines.Don't wait for her. Cause she's mine.CHORUSCharlene. Charlene. I got to write a letter to Charlene. Charlene.Cause you should know the words she says to me. (Won't you be my guy?)Are the words she says to me. (And it feels so nice.) A letter to Charlene. Charlene.I've got to get a message to Charlene. Charlene. And give the girl an answer to her words.Answer to her words. And she's the one for me. The one. Oh! Oh! A letter to Charlene.
