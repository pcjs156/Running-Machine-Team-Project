The snow glows whiteon the mountain tonightNot a footprint to be seenA kingdom of isolationAnd it looks like I'm the queenThe wind is howling likethis swirling storm insideCouldn't keep it inheaven knows I've triedDon't let them indon't let them seeBe the good girlyou always have to beConceal don't feeldon't let them knowWell now they knowLet it go let it goCan't hold it back anymoreLet it go let it goTurn away and slam the doorI don't care what they're going to sayLet the storm rage onThe cold never bothered me anywayIt's funny how some distancemakes everything seem smallAnd the fears that once controlledme can't get to me at allIt's time to see what I can doTo test the limits and break throughNo right no wrong no rules for meI'm freeLet it go let it goI am one with the wind and skyLet it go let it goYou'll never see me cryHere I stand and here I'll stayLet the storm rage onMy power flurries throughthe air into the groundMy soul is spiraling infrozen fractals all aroundAnd one thought crystallizeslike an icy blastI'm never going backthe past is in the pastLet it go let it goAnd I'll rise like the break of dawnLet it go let it goThat perfect girl is goneHere I stand in the light of dayLet the storm rage onThe cold never bothered me anyway
