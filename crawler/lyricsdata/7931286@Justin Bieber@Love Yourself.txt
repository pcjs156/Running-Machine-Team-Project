For all the times that you rain on my paradeAnd all the clubs you get in using my nameYou think you broke my heartoh girl for goodness sakeYou think I'm crying on my ownwell I ain'tAnd I didn't wanna write a songcause I didn't want anyone thinking I still careI don't but you still hit my phone upAnd baby I be movin' onand I think you should be somethin'I don't wanna hold backmaybe you should know thatMy mama don't like youand she likes everyoneAnd I never like toadmit that I was wrongAnd I've been so caught up in my jobdidn't see what's going onAnd now I knowI'm better sleeping on my ownCause if you like the wayyou look that muchOh baby you should goand love yourselfAnd if you think thatI'm still holdin' on to somethin'You should go and love yourselfBut when you told me that you hated my friendsThe only problem was with you and not themAnd every time you told me my opinion was wrongAnd tried to make me forget where I came fromAnd I didn't wanna write a songcause I didn't want anyone thinking I still careI don't but you still hit my phone upAnd baby I be movin' onand I think you should be somethin'I don't wanna hold backmaybe you should know thatMy mama don't like youand she likes everyoneAnd I never like to admitthat I was wrongAnd I've been so caught up in my jobdidn't see what's going onAnd now I knowI'm better sleeping on my ownCause if you like the way you look that muchOh baby you should go and love yourselfAnd if you think thatI'm still holdin' on to somethin'You should go and love yourselfFor all the times that you made me feel smallI fell in love now I fear nothin' at allI never felt so low when I was vulnerableWas I a fool to let you break down my wallsCause if you like the way you look that muchOh baby you should go and love yourselfAnd if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'You should go and love yourselfCause if you like the way you look that muchOh baby you should go and love yourselfAnd if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'You should go and love yourself
