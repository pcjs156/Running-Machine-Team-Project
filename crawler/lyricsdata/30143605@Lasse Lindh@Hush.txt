Through the endless daydreamI saw you on the way backThere I walked with you in my armsThrough the blurry darkness Who's veiling on the twilightWe've been far away from my fearsSomewhere else I'll see you Our days be like a blossom Blooming all around you so brightBy and by I'll miss you and your laugh like a sunshineFading into shadow of tearsAll around me is your lightWith you everything so shinesHow come we'll leave all behind Cause your love is falling on my heart And I'm falling for youFalling with broken wings againHush now my angel I will always be with you In your pretty smile in a glow of tearsOut across the frosty nightI'll be there with youMaybe someday you'll wake up alone without me But don't cry again I'll be waiting hereWhere the moon is on the riseAs the olden daysI could just go with youbetween our time Where they can't find us somehowYou could just come away with me out thereWhere we could dream away All dayHush now my angel I will always be with you In your pretty smile in a glow of tearsOut across the frosty nightI'll be there with youMaybe you'll always breath in me ever in my heart All the little pieces of you look how they shine above Come away with me tonight We'll be dreaming away thereMaybe you'll always breath in me ever in my heart All the little pieces of you look how they shine above Come away with me tonight We'll be dreaming away thereAlways
