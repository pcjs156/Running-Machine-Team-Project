Lately I’ve been thinkin’Thinkin’ ’bout what we hadI know it was hardIt was all that we knew yeahHave you been drinkin’to take all the pain awayI wish that I could give youwhat you deserve‘Cause nothing can everever replace youNothing can make mefeel like you doYou know there’s no oneI can relate toAnd know we won’t find a lovethat’s so trueThere’s nothing like usThere’s nothing likeyou and meTogether through the stormThere’s nothing like usThere’s nothing likeyou and me togetherI gave you everything babyEverything I had to giveGirl why would youpush me awayLost in confusionlike an illusionYou know I’m used tomaking your dayBut that is the past nowWe didn’t last nowGuess that this is meant to beTell me was it worth itWe were so perfectBut baby I just want you to seeThere’s nothing like usThere’s nothing likeyou and meTogether through the stormThere’s nothing like usThere’s nothing likeyou and me togetherThere’s nothing like usThere’s nothing likeyou and meTogether through the stormThere’s nothing like usThere’s nothing likeyou and me together
