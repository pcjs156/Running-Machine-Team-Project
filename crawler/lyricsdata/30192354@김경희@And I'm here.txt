And I'm here just just like I used to beWe were here in old days with you with meAll my fears have gone when you whisper to meNo matter how near or far apart apartWhen you feel so lonely Have you completely erased me I'll be here to shelter youfrom your memories from yoursWhen you feel so lonely While I still feel your breeze I'll be here here for youholding your hands again holding your handsIf I could fly above the clouds like all the birdsAnd I could hold you for a while to let you feel my pulseStill here all aloneMy whole life and all my heartYou're my whole life and all my heartAnd I'm here home homeWith you With me
