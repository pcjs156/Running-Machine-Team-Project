See Ya Never gone my way Better will someday Never far awaySee Ya Never gone my way Better on my stay Never far awayRound and round and I never know why Round and round and it will show us way out It’s my delightAs day goes by you hold on tight another day You’re wondering why but you know why no other way Somedays the sun will shine down Somedays the moon will cry Tomorrow we‘ll see Tomorrow we‘ll be As we go on our way The world in your eyes forever is lie as we go on our way There is a thousand things to knowSometimes we’re standing by the things we never understand As we go on our own way The sun goes down The tides are low I’ll see you on the day Letting you go on your way See Ya Never gone my way Never we‘ll someday Never far awaySee Ya Never gone my way Never on my day Never far awayRound and roundand I never know whyRound and roundand it will show us way outIt’s my delight
