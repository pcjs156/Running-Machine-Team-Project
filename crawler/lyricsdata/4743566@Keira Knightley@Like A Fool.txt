We take a chance from time to timeAnd put our necks out on the lineAnd you have broken every promise that we madeAnd I have loved you anywayTook a fine time to leave me hangin' out to dryUnderstand now I'm greivin'So don't you waste my timeCause you have takenAll the wind out from my sailsAnd I have loved you just the sameWe finally find thisthen you're goneBeen chasin' rainbows all alongAnd you have cursed meWhen there's no one left to blameAnd I have loved youJust the sameAnd you have broken every single fucking ruleAnd I have loved youlike a fool
