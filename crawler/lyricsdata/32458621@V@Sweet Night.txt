On my pillowCan’t get me tiredSharing my fragile truthThat I still hope the door is openCuz the windowOpened one time with you and meNow my forever’s falling downWondering if you’d want me nowHow could I knowOne day I’d wake up feeling moreBut I had already reached the shoreGuess we were ships in the nightNight nightWe were ships in the nightNight nightI’m wonderingAre you my best friendFeel’s like a river’s rushingthrough my mindI wanna ask youIf this is all just in my headMy heart is pounding tonightI wonderIf youAre too good to be trueAnd would it be alright if IPulled you closerHow could I knowOne day I’d wake up feeling moreBut I had already reached the shoreGuess we were ships in the nightNight nightWe were ships in the nightNight night
