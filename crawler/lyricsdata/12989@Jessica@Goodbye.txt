I can see the pain living in your eyes And I know how hard you try You deserve to have so much more I can feel your hurt and I sympathize And I'll never critisize All you ever meant to my life I don't want to let you down I don't want to lead you on I don't want to hold you back from where you might belong You would never ask me why My heart is so disguised I just can't live a lie anymore I would rather hurt myself Than to ever make you cry There's nothing left to say but goodbye  goodbye  You deserve a chance at the kind of love I'm not sure I'm worthy of Losing you is painful for me I don't want to let you down I don't want to lead you on I don't want to hold you back from where you might belong You would never ask me why My heart is so disguised I just can't live a lie anymore I would rather hurt myself Than to ever make you cry There's nothing left to say but goodbye  You would never ask me why My heart is so disguised I just can't live a lie anymore I would rather hurt myself Than to ever make you cry There's nothing left to try No it's gonna hurt us more There's no other way than to say goodbye  goodbye
