When you were asleepAnd I was out walkingThe voices started to speakAnd they wouldn't stop talkingThere were signs all aroundIt really got my mind racingYou were right all alongSomething's gotta changeHold onHold on they're not for meHold onCause everything'scoming up rosesRosesWe were back on the streetFound a song that's worth singingThe blur that knows a defeatWhile your victory bell's ringingMy whole life's turned aroundFor this thing you keep chasingYou were right all alongBut it's me who's got to changeHold onHold on they're not for meHold onCause everything'scoming up rosesHold on Hold onAaahhhHold on Hold onAaahhhHold on Hold onHold on Hold onAaahhhHold on Hold onAaahhhHold on Hold onAaahhhHold on Hold onHold onHold on they're not for meHold onCause everything's coming upRosesEverything's coming up rosesEverything's coming up rosesHold on Hold onRosesHold on Hold onEverything's coming upHold on Hold onEverything's coming upHold on Hold onRosesHold on Hold onRoses
